A game like billiards...The project showcases the use of painting and animation on a Graphic Surface including some cool Physics to simulate moving disks. The Physics includes conservation of Momentum with the heavy striker hitting the various lighter disks and simulating friction. The act of putting this on Google playstore was also quite educational.
